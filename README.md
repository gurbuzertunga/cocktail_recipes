# Cocktail Recipes

This is a React web application where you can navigate through different cocktail categories and get the recipe for any of them, along with an image, ingredients, and instructions. Each recipe is loaded with a URL displaying the recipe ID.

Design belongs to me.

## Features & Usage

- When a recipe from the results is clicked a new component with the recipe details is loaded. The URL changes and will include the recipe's ID.
- In the recipe view, you have the name of the recipe, ingredients and quantities, an image, and written instructions.
- You can navigate back to the home page, and still see the previously selected category.
- Design is partially responsive although not completely optimized for smartphones.
